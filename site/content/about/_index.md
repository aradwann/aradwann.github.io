I have been always interested in tech and, that's why I joined engineering school in the first place. When I was learning python for my graduation project, I liked programming and topics related to it (OSI model, API design, OOP/functional paradigms, .etc) and decided to take it more seriously thus, I took courses on Coursera/ Advanced Web Development Nanodegree on Udacity (certificates on my LinkedIn profile), read books/articles, enjoyed coding with various technologies (projects on my GitHub profile).

My **blog** is where I write and reflect from time to time on a variety of topics to understand things better or just for fun.

If you find any mistakes or something unclear I'd be happy if you contact me to discuss it or submit a PR :)
